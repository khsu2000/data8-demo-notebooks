# data8-p-values-demo
A short jupyter notebook that explains how to calculate and interpret p-values. 

In this notebook, we break down the definition of a p-value and empirically calculate a p-value based off a example drawn from Data 8 lecture (determining if a coin is biased or fair with observed data). 

As a disclaimer, this is not official course content, but rather a study resource I made independently. Additionally, in Data 8, we use the [datascience library](http://data8.org/datascience/). For this notebook, I used matplotlib to create the visualizations, so the actual code is not in scope for the course.
